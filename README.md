# Rafael "Pael" Gutierrez

Hi! I'm Pael (he/him). I'm a geodetic engineer who transitioned to tech. When I wrote a Python script to determine Bone Clinkz's (my favorite Dota hero) damage based on item stats, enemy stats, and hero level, I quickly fell in love with coding.  I've been working as a software engineer for over three years. I've gained experience working with [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en), [Arup](https://www.arup.com/), and [Kodexa](https://kodexa.ai/), and have quickly learned different tech stacks (Python, Javascript, SAP ABAP, Vue, etc.) along the way.

My _weapon of choice_ is Python, and actively learning Go and other backend stuff on [bootdev](boot.dev). Right now, I'm doing part-time work with the construction firm [SBStruc](https://www.facebook.com/SBStruc) to create an app that automates boring, mundane processes in their structrual design workflow. Check it out here: [SBS-BESI](https://github.com/SBStruc/SBS-BES)

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend development, preferrably writing in Python or Go. If you're hiring, let's chat!


### Random things about me:
- I play League (ADC, Dia 2 peak), Dota 2 (Pos 1, Legend 4 peak), and Wild Rift (ADC, GM peak)
- I am the vocalist of **[Room for Cielo](https://www.youtube.com/roomforcielo)**, an _old-soul_ pop band in the Philippines
