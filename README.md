# Hi, I'm Rafael Gutierrez!

I'm a geodetic engineer who transitioned to tech. I discovered my love for coding when I chose to use Python for a vector analysis assignment instead of Excel. Python made tasks much easier and more efficient than Excel.  I've been working as a software engineer for over three years. I've gained experience working with [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/us-en), [Arup](https://www.arup.com/), and [Kodexa](https://kodexa.ai/), and have quickly learned different tech stacks (React, Javascript, SAP ABAP, Vue, etc.) along the way.

My _weapon of choice_ is Python and currently learning Go and other backend stuff on [bootdev](boot.dev). Right now, I'm doing part-time work with the construction firm [SBStruc](https://www.facebook.com/SBStruc) to automate their structural design workflow using Python. 

I'm currently on the look out for a role in backend development, preferrably writing in Python or Go. If you're hiring, let's chat!
